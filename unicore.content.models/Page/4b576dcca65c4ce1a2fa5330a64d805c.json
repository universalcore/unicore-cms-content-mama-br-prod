Take care not to lose it and take it to every doctor\u2019s appointment.\r\n\r\nRemember: you and your baby need to get immunised when you are both well and do not have the disease. A vaccination cannot cure the disease once it has started.\r\n\r\nIf you and your baby are immunised, it means that you can fight serious illnesses if you come into contact with them. You cannot get immunised if you are already sick, so do it when you are both well.\r\n\r\nImmunisation helps your baby to fight off some of the most dangerous illnesses. This will protect you both from suffering and distress. No mother likes seeing her baby sick. \r\n\r\nYour baby needs to get immunised while he is well and it is important that you get it done at the right time.\r\n\r\nYour baby will need more than 1 dose of some immunisations. If you want to know what immunisations your baby needs and when, talk to a doctor. They will tell you when to get your baby immunised. \r\n\r\n",
