You may get folic acid by eating the right food while you are pregnant. \r\n\r\nIt's good to eat plenty of dark green vegetables like kale and spinach, as well as potatoes, peanuts and eggs. These foods contain folic acid.\r\n\r\nFolic acid is also found in fruit like mangoes and papayas. \r\n\r\nWhen you are cooking, you could try to leave the vegetables a bit crunchy. This preserves their goodness. \r\n\r\nIn the first 3 months of your pregnancy, your baby's brain and nerve systems are growing fast. Your body needs plenty of folic acid at this time. You can start taking a daily folic acid tablet early in your pregnancy. You may also be given iron tablets. You may be able to get them at a posto de sa\u00fade. Go as soon as you think you are pregnant.\r\n\r\n",
