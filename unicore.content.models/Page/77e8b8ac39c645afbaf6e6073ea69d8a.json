  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nIt is important to keep your baby warm as soon as he is born. Babies cannot adjust to the new, cooler, temperature outside the womb, and can lose heat very quickly. \r\n\r\nWhen your baby is born, he will be wet, so make sure he is dried.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to bathe your baby as soon as he is born. Right after the birth, clean only the cord. He does not need to be bathed for at least 6 hours. Bathing your baby too soon could make him sick and cold\r\n\r\nAsk your birth attendant to lay your baby on your bare chest. Your warmth will help prevent him from getting too cold. Hold him firmly so he does not slip and fall.\r\n\r\nLay a clean, warm blanket over both of you. This will keep the heat in. You can make a sling to keep him safe. Also, if you can, put a small hat or a cloth wrapper over his head. Babies lose a lot of heat through their heads. \r\n\r\nKeeping your baby warm through skin-to-skin contact will also give you and your baby time to get to know each other. You can see who has been kicking you all this time! Holding your baby this way will also mean that your baby can easily reach the breast and start feeding. \r\n\r\n",
