They can be life-threatening for you and your baby. They can cause health difficulties for your baby as she grows up. But do not quit suddenly, because this can lead to pregnancy loss. Talk to a doctor about how you can quit safely.   \r\n\r\nCrack or cocaine can slow down your baby's growth and cause problems with learning and behaviour when she is older.\r\n\r\nIf you use heroin or tranquillisers, it is vital to get medical help as soon as you can. Heroin can cause pregnancy loss or premature birth, or your baby could be stillborn. Heroin can make it difficult for your baby to breathe just after she is born. Trying to quit on your own could be dangerous for you both. The safest way to quit is with medical help.\r\n\r\nIf you take street drugs during pregnancy, your baby may have withdrawal symptoms when she is born. Doctors can check her for signs of withdrawal, and treat her.\r\n\r\nCall the government hotline for drug users: 132.
