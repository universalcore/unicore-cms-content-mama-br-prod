Add cashew nuts and peanuts to your food to make it even healthier. Fruits like mangoes, papayas and jackfruits are good. Get lots of them. Try to have 1 extra handful of food with every meal. Do not go without food for too long. Carry some food with you if you have to go somewhere.\r\n\r\n2.\t**Get check-ups** while you are pregnant. Try to have at least 6 visits to your doctor.
