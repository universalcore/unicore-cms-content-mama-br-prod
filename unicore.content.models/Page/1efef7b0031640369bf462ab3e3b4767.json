Work out how long it will take to get there. Talk with your family about transport and decide who you will have with you. Choose someone you trust.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot get to a casa de parto for the birth:\r\n\r\n - \tIt is vital to have a skilled attendant. Make sure your family knows how to contact the attendant. Your attendant may have a birth kit. It can contain a sheet, gloves, clean string and tools for cutting your baby's cord. \r\n\r\n - \tIf you cannot get a birth kit, find a clean sheet to have your baby on and 2 cloths, one to dry your baby and one to wrap her in. Have 2 pieces of clean string,  a clean, sharp knife or a clean pair of scissors ready. \r\n\r\n - \tYour attendant must wash her hands and you must wash between your legs. Get plenty of clean, safe, boiled water and soap ready.\r\n\r\n",
