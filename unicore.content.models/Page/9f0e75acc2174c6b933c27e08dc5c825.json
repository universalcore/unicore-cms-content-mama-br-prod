Try to eat a mixture of different coloured foods every day and you will gain weight steadily as your baby grows.\r\n\r\nYou may find that your appetite changes throughout your pregnancy:\r\n\r\n - \tIn the first few weeks, your appetite may decrease and you may not feel like eating proper meals, especially if you are nauseous or are vomiting.\r\n\r\n - \tDuring the middle part of your pregnancy, your appetite may be the same as before you were pregnant or it may be slightly increased.\r\n\r\n - \tTowards the end of your pregnancy, your appetite will probably increase. Eat fruit, vegetables, nuts, eggs and meat. Explain to your family that you need more food to grow a healthy baby. Ask them if you can buy more of these foods. You need an extra handful of food with each meal. You may also need a small snack between meals.\r\n\r\nYou may start craving certain foods. Some pregnant women crave non-foods such as soil. Eating soil or other non-foods can be harmful to you and your baby. Do not eat them. Soil can cause constipation or give you worms.\r\n\r\n",
